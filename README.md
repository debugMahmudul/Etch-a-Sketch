# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a simple web-based sketching tool that generates a 16x16 grid of squares by default, allowing users to draw by hovering their mouse to color squares tomato red. Users can resize the grid (up to 100x100) via a button prompt, with the new grid dynamically adjusting to maintain proportional square sizes. The goal is to provide an interactive, user-friendly interface for creating pixel-like art with flexible grid dimensions.

## Features

- Initial 16x16 grid of squares for drawing.
- Hover-to-draw functionality that colors squares tomato red on mouseover.
- Customizable grid size through a user prompt (1 to 100 squares per side).
- Dynamic resizing of grid cells to maintain proportional dimensions based on user input.
- Input validation to ensure grid size is a valid number within the 1-100 range.
- Grid reset functionality that clears the previous grid before creating a new one.
